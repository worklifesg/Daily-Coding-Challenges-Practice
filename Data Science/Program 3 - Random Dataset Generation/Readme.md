*Write a function that can generate dataset [x,y] format by defining seed and random function.*

- [ ] The functions are defined in a class and should generate same random numbers for particular seed.
- [ ] The dataset values for x and y should be normalized i.e. [0,1] and rounded off up to 2 decimals points.
- [ ] Can only use standard defined python libraries (No libraries such as numpy, random modules are allowed)

***Testing Case:***

* seed(1) for x, seed(2) for y for 10 random numbers

  dataset = [[0.17, 0.33], [0.5, 1.0], [0.44, 0.89], [0.28, 0.56], [0.83, 0.61], [0.39, 0.78], [0.11, 0.22], [0.33, 0.67], [1.0, 0.94], [0.89, 0.72]]

* seed(42) for x, seed(21) for y for 5 random numbers

  dataset = [[0.71, 0.33], [1.0, 1.0], [0.76, 0.89], [0.06, 0.56], [0.18, 0.61]]
